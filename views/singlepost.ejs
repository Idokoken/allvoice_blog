  <h2 class="my-3">How to prepare Nigeria fried Rice</h2>
  <p>
    Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version
    relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil for
    crisping it up. The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich
    but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of the most popular choices in
    Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you’d like. If you
    would love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps
    entirely! This fried rice is entirely different from the popular Asian
    Chicken Fried Rice because the depth of the taste in the later comes from
    the Soy sauce while the depth of taste of the later comes from the Curry
    powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes, and of course the abundance of vegetables
    like Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.

    <li>It’s o.k to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat!</li>

      Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, otherwise, you will end up
      with a soggy fried rice.

      Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t
      overcook your veggies.

      I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn, and
      Green Beans. However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers can also be used.

      In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn up the
      heat to high during the frying process and stir continuously as you allow
      the rice to heat up.

      I added pieces of beef liver in my fried Rice, a lot of people like this
      as well, but if you don’t want it you are free to leave it out, you will
      still enjoy the total goodness of the Fried Rice.

      When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or Turkey
      stock because of their mils taste. The beef stock should be avoided as it
      can overpower the taste of the fried rice
